<|image|>If the line m is parallel to the side AB, what is angle a? You know the answer is A option. Options: A. 130o; B. 25o; C. 65o; D. 50o<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

<SUMMARY> To solve the problem, I will use the properties of parallel lines and angles in a triangle. I will identify the relationships between the angles and use the given information to find the measure of angle a. </SUMMARY>

<CAPTION> The image shows a triangle ABC with a line m parallel to side AB. Angle a is formed between line m and side AC. The triangle has a marked angle of 50째 at vertex A. </CAPTION>

<REASONING> Since line m is parallel to side AB, angle a is equal to angle 2 (an alternate interior angle) due to the parallel line theorem. In triangle ABC, angle 2 is equal to angle 1 (an angle in the triangle) because they are corresponding angles. Given that angle 1 is 50째, angle 2 is also 50째. Therefore, angle a is 50째. </REASONING>

<CONCLUSION> D. 50o </CONCLUSION><|eot_id|>
