<SUMMARY> To solve the problem, I will analyze the geometric properties of the triangle and the parallel line. I will use the given information and the properties of parallel lines to determine the measure of angle a. </SUMMARY>

<CAPTION> The image shows a triangle with a line parallel to one of its sides. The triangle has a right angle, and the parallel line intersects the opposite side. The angle of interest, labeled as angle a, is formed between the parallel line and the side of the triangle. </CAPTION>

<REASONING> Given that line m is parallel to side AB, angle a is equal to angle 2 due to the Alternate Interior Angles Theorem. Since angle 2 is 50 degrees, angle a is also 50 degrees. </REASONING>

<CONCLUSION> D. 50o </CONCLUSION><|eot_id|>
