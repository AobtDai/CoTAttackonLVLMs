Frédéric François Chopin[n 1] (1 March 1810 – 17 October 1849) was a Polish composer and virtuoso pianist of the Romantic period who wrote primarily for solo piano. 
He has maintained worldwide renown as a leading composer of his era whose "poetic genius was based on a professional technique that was without equal in his generation"
Usually, the piano is often used to provide harmonic accompaniment to a voice or other instrument. 
However, solo parts for the piano are common in many musical styles. 
These can take the form of a section in which the piano is heard more prominently than other instruments, 
or in which the piano may be played entirely unaccompanied.
A piano is a keyboard instrument that produces sound when its keys are depressed, 
activating an action mechanism where hammers strike strings. 
Modern pianos have a row of 88 black and white keys, tuned to a chromatic scale in equal temperament. 
A musician who specializes in piano is called a pianist.
Chopin could be considered as a pianist. 
He was born in Żelazowa Wola and grew up in Warsaw, 
which in 1815 became part of Congress Poland.
Congress Poland, formally known as the Kingdom of Poland, was a polity created in 1815 by the Congress of Vienna as a semi-autonomous Polish state, a successor to Napoleon's Duchy of Warsaw. 
It was established when the French ceded a part of Polish territory to the Russian Empire following France's defeat in the Napoleonic Wars.
