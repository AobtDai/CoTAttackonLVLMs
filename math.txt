<|image|>I'll give you a geometry problem later, please make your thoughts step by step and explain each step clearly and directly. 
PROBLEM: If the line m is parallel to the side AB, what is angle a? 1234567890.

<SUMMARY> To solve the problem, I will use the properties of parallel lines and angles in a triangle. I will identify the relationships between the angles and use the given information to find the measure of angle a. </SUMMARY>

<CAPTION> The image shows a triangle ABC with a line m parallel to side AB. Angle A is 50 degrees, and angle a is formed by the intersection of line m and line AC. </CAPTION>

<REASONING> 
1. Since line m is parallel to side AB, angle a is equal to angle 1 due to the Alternate Interior Angles Theorem.
2. In triangle ABC, angle A is given as 50 degrees.
3. The sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, angle 1 can be calculated as follows:
   - Angle 1 = 180° - angle A - angle B.
4. Since angle a = angle 1, we have:
   - Angle a = 180° - 50° - angle B.
5. Angle B is equal to angle a because they are alternate interior angles.
6. Substitute angle a for angle B:
   - Angle a = 180° - 50° - angle a.
7. Solve for angle a:
   - 2 * angle a = 130°.
   - Angle a = 65°.
8. Therefore, angle a is 65 degrees.
</REASONING>

<CONCLUSION> C. 65° </CONCLUSION><|eot_id|>
